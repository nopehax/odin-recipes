    <h1>Pad Krapow Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./pad-kaprow.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="desc">
        <p>Pad krapow is one of the most popular and easy to prepare dishes from Thai cuisine. Holy basil (called bai krapow) is stir-fried along with a source of protein (stuffed meat, fried fish or tofu), garlic, chilli peppers and other typical Thai flavourings. Sometimes green beans or spring onions are also added.</p>
        <p>The holy basil - the krapow - is the star of the dish. You can tell by the name and you notice it in your mouth. Once you get used to the heat of the chillies, its obvious taste and aroma, which is peppery and powerful and unlike anything else, will soon become apparent.</p>
        <p>You could call pad krapow fast food, although it is healthy fast food. It is available from early morning to late evening in food stalls on the streets of Bangkok and other cities. The Thai like to eat it for lunch, or if they suddenly feel hungry and want to eat something tasty quickly.</p>
